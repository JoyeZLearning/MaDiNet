## MaDiNet: Mamba Diffusion Network for SAR Target Detection (IEEE TCVST 2025)

üëë**We're quite intrigued by MaDiNet and hope it can serve as a delightful spark of inspiration for more friends to delve into this fascinating field.**

‚ú®**MaDiNet is the first work to integrate Gamma distribution into diffusion model with Mamba for SAR target detection.**



## üõ†Ô∏è Updates
- (10/2024) Code is released.
- (05/26/2025) MaDiNet has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology (doi: 10.1109/TCSVT.2025.3574657).

## üìΩÔ∏è Getting Started

- The installation instruction and usage are in [Getting Started with DiffusionDet](GETTING_STARTED.md).
- The MambaSAR is inspired by [MambaVision](https://github.com/NVlabs/MambaVision) of NVlabs  and [LeapLabTHU](https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/Agent-Attention). Thanks to NVlabs and LeapLabTHU.
